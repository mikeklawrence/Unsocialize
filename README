A Google Chrome extension for bypassing Facebook social reader app install
requests by providing a right-click menu item.

When your Facebook News Feed contains items such as "John Doe read an
article", the article link often redirects you to an app install request, which
will access your personal information and post on your timeline.

This extension provides a right-click menu item: "Unsocialize", which will open
the linked article in a new tab, bypassing the install request and any other
tracking metrics.

I appreciate your comments, suggestions and bug notifications:

GENERAL INFORMATION

This repository contains a Google Chrome extension in the package/ subfolder.
This subfolder is what is sent (in a zip archive) to the Chrome Web Store. For
more information on writing Chroms extensions, see

http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html

INSTALLATION

1. Launch Google Chrome
2. Go to the URL chrome://settings/extensions
3. Check "Developer mode" (if it isn't already)
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Navigate to the package/ subfolder, and click OK.

DEBUGGING

1. Go to the Chrome Extensions Page (chrome://settings/extensions)
2. Click the expansion arrow next to Unsocializer.
3. Click the active view _generated_background_page.html

A developer tools window should open, you can add breakpoints and step through
the JavaScript code here. For more info see

For development purposes, I recommend removing the documentUrlPatterns attribute
from the _usMenuItem variable in unsocializer.js. This attribute restricts
unsocializer to only appear for webpages on Facebook. Removing this attribute
allows testing on arbitrary pages, such as the included urls.html. ***Don't
forget to change this attribute back before committing!***
