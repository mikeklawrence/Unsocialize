DESCRIPTION

  A browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari for
  bypassing Facebook social reader app install requests by providing a
  right-click menu item.
  
  When your Facebook News Feed contains items such as "John Doe read an
  article", the article link often redirects you to an app install request,
  which will access your personal information and post on your timeline.
  
  This extension provides a right-click menu item: "Unsocialize", which will
  open the linked article in a new tab, bypassing the install request and any
  other tracking metrics.
  
  It should work for any link from within Facebook, and also bypasses tracking
  metrics even for links that don't direct to social reader app requests.
  
  I appreciate your comments, suggestions and bug notifications:

BUILD

  All browser-specific code is stored in firefox/, chrome/ or safari/.
  Common source is in common/
  
  A makefile is used to prepare the extensions by copying common files and
  creating zip archives. It has targets: 'firefox' (producing unsocialize.xpi),
  'chrome' (producing unsocialize.zip), 'safari' (which copies common sources to
  safari/unsocialize.safariextension) and 'all' (producing all three).

  (for notes on packing Chrome and Safari extensions, see the INSTALLATION
  section.)
  
  'make clean' removes the copied common files and packaged extensions.

INSTALLATION

  Firefox

    Drag unsocialize.xpi into a Firefox window and restart.

  Chrome

    Go to chrome://settings/extensions, check "developer mode", "load unpacked
    extension", and select the chrome/ folder.
    
    The unsocialize.zip file can be uploaded to the chrome web store. To create
    a packaged extension, select "pack extension" from
    chrome://settings/extensions.

  Safari
    
    In the Advanced pane of the Safari Preferences dialog, ensure "Show Develop
    menu in menu bar" is selected.

    In the Develop menu, select "Show Extension Builder". Click the '+' icon in
    the bottom-left of the window, select "Add Extension", and navigate to
    safari/unsocialize.safariextension/

    The extension can be packed by clicking "Build Package", which produces a
    .safariextz file that can be dragged directly into Safari.

DEVELOPING

  Chrome

    The source can be viewed by visiting chrome://settings/extensions, clicking
    the expansion arrow next to Unsocialize, and selecting the active view
    "_generated_background_page.html". Chrome's debugger should open
    automatically.

    A developer tools window should open, you can add breakpoints and step
    through the JavaScript code here. For more info see

    For more information on writing Chrome extensions, see
    http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html

  Firefox
    
    You should create a dev profile and configure it as per 
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment

    Documentation for Firefox extension development can be found at
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions

    When first starting out, the following tutorial is useful:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_School

  Safari

    You will need to sign up for an apple developer account at
    https://developer.apple.com/ and create a key.

    The Safari Extension documentation can be found here
    https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/navigation/

    Debugging: The safari extension consists of a global.html file, and a
    page-injected script injected.js. The global page, contains an in-line
    script and also includes the unsocialize.js common source.

    For more information on debugging these, see
    https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/DebuggingExtensions/DebuggingExtensions.html
