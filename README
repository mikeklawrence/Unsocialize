DESCRIPTION

  A browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox for bypassing
  Facebook social reader app install requests by providing a right-click menu
  item.
  
  When your Facebook News Feed contains items such as "John Doe read an
  article", the article link often redirects you to an app install request,
  which will access your personal information and post on your timeline.
  
  This extension provides a right-click menu item: "Unsocialize", which will
  open the linked article in a new tab, bypassing the install request and any
  other tracking metrics.
  
  It should work for any link from within Facebook, and also bypasses tracking
  metrics even for links that don't direct to social reader app requests.
  
  I appreciate your comments, suggestions and bug notifications:

BUILD

  The code and configuration for the Firefox and Chrome extensions are contained
  in firefox/ and chrome/ respectively. Common source is in common/
  
  A makefile is used to package the extensions by copying common files and
  creating a zip archive. It has targets: 'firefox' (producing unsocialize.xpi),
  'chrome' (producing unsocialize.zip), and 'all' (producing both).
  
  'make clean' removes the copied common files and packaged extensions.

INSTALLATION

  Firefox

    Drag unsocialize.xpi into a Firefox window and restart.

  Chrome

    Go to chrome://settings/extensions, check "developer mode", "load unpacked
    extension", and select the chrome/ folder.
    
    The unsocialize.zip file can be uploaded to the chrome web store. To create
    a packaged extension, select "pack extension" from
    chrome://settings/extensions.

DEVELOPING

  Chrome

    The source can be viewed by visiting chrome://settings/extensions, clicking
    the expansion arrow next to Unsocialize, and selecting the active view
    "_generated_background_page.html". Chrome's debugger should open
    automatically.

    A developer tools window should open, you can add breakpoints and step
    through the JavaScript code here. For more info see

    For more information on writing Chrome extensions, see
    http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/index.html

    *NOTE* It is recommended that the _usMenuItem.documentUrlPatterns (in
    unsocialize.js) is removed for development.  This attribute restricts
    unsocialize to only appear for webpages on Facebook. Removing this attribute
    allows testing on arbitrary pages, such as the included urls.html. ***Don't
    forget to change this attribute back before committing!***

  Firefox
    
    You should create a dev profile and configure it as per
